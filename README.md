**ðŸ“š DATA COLLECTION:**
The data collection process involved retrieving various data points from YouTube using the YouTube Data API. Retrieve channel information, videos details, playlists and comments.

**ðŸ’¾ Database Storage:**
*The collected YouTube data was transformed into pandas dataframes. Before that, a new database and tables were created using the MySQL Workbench. With the help of mysql.connector, the data was inserted into the respective tables. The database could be accessed and managed in the MySQL environment provided by Workbench.

**ðŸ“‹ Data Analysis:**
By using YouTube channel data stored in the MySQL database, performed MySQL queries to answer 10 questions about the YouTube channels. When selecting a question, the results will be displayed in the Streamlit application in the form of tables.

**ðŸ“˜ Usage:**
Enter a YouTube channel ID or name in the input field in Data collection option from sidebar menu.
Click the "Data Collection & Upload" button to fetch and store channel data in the MySQL database.
Select Analysis option from the sidebar menu to analyze data.
